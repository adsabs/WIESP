## Workshop on Information Extraction from Scientific Publications

The number of scientific papers published per year has exploded in recent years, strengthening its value as one of the main drivers for scientific progress. In astronomy alone, more than 41,000 new articles are published every year and the vast majority are available either via an open-access model or via pre-print services. Indexing the article's full-text in search engines helps discover and retrieve vital scientific information to continue building on the shoulders of giants, informing policy, and making evidence-based decisions. Nevertheless, it is difficult to navigate in this ocean of data; finding articles rely heavily on string matching searches and following citations/references. Still, new approaches are necessary to differentiate the signal from the noise more easily (e.g., finding the key articles about the medical condition we are interested in).

Simple string matching has substantial limitations, human language is ambiguous in nature, context matters, and we frequently use the same word and acronyms to represent a multitude of different meanings. Extracting structured and semantically relevant information from scientific publications (e.g., named-entity recognition, summarization, citation intention, linkage to knowledge graphs) allows better selection and filter articles. 

## Second Workshop at IJCNLP-AACL 2023

Building on the success of the First WIESP at AACL-IJCNLP 2022, the Second Workshop on Information Extraction from Scientific Publications (WIESP) will provide a platform to researchers to foster discussion and research on information extraction, mining, generation, and knowledge discovery from scientific publications using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques. A lot of technological change happened in one year (since the 1st WIESP), especially with Generative Artificial Intelligence research. We are incorporating a few additional topics to stay abreast with the latest developments and research in the community. The 2nd iteration of WIESP would focus on the following topics  (but not limited to):

## Topics

- Large Language Models (LLMs) for Science
- Application of LLMs on information extraction, generation, mining and knowledge discovery from scientific publications
- Probing LLMs for scientific fact checking and misinformation
- Scientific document parsing
- Scientific named-entity recognition
- Scientific article summarization
- Question-answering on scientific articles
- Citation context/span extraction
- Structured information extraction from full-text, tables, figures, bibliography
- Novel datasets curated from scientific publications
- Argument extraction and mining
- Challenges in information extraction from scientific articles
- Building knowledge graphs via mining scientific literature; querying scientific knowledge graphs
- Novel tools for IE on scientific literature and interaction with users
- Mathematical information extraction
- Scientific concepts, facts extraction
- Visualizing scientific knowledge
- Bibliometric and Altmetric studies via information extraction from scientific articles and metadata

## Call for Papers

In addition to research paper presentations, WIESP would also feature keynote talks, a panel discussion, and shared tasks. We will update the details on our website as and when they become available. We especially welcome participation from academic and research institutions, government and industry labs, publishers, and information service providers. Projects and organizations using NLP/ML techniques in their text mining and enrichment efforts are also welcome to participate. We strongly encourage participation of students, researchers, and science practitioners from diverse backgrounds, especially from underrepresented groups and communities, to be a part of WIESP events, and pro-actively make the workshop a diverse and inclusive one.
