## Workshop on Information Extraction from Scientific Publications (WIESP)

The surge in scientific paper publications has greatly contributed to scientific advancement. To navigate this vast amount of data and facilitate discovery, incorporating the metadata, full text, and citations into search engines is crucial. A popular and open example is the NASA Astrophysics Data System, which offers many ways to discover research articles of interest within a curated collection of 17 million records. However, navigating through this vast amount of data presents considerable challenges. To overcome them, extracting structured and semantically meaningful information from scientific publications becomes imperative.

## Second Workshop at IJCNLP-AACL 2023

Building on the success of the [First WIESP at AACL-IJCNLP 2022](2022), the [Second Workshop on Information Extraction from Scientific Publications (WIESP)](2023) will provide a platform for researchers to foster discussion and research on information extraction, mining, generation, and knowledge discovery from scientific publications using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques. Much technological change happened in one year (since the 1st WIESP), especially with Generative Artificial Intelligence research. We are incorporating a few additional topics to stay abreast with the latest developments and research in the community. The 2nd iteration of WIESP would focus on the following topics  (but not limited to):

## Topics

- Large Language Models (LLMs) for Science
- Application of LLMs on information extraction, generation, mining and knowledge discovery from scientific publications
- Probing LLMs for scientific fact-checking and misinformation
- Scientific document parsing
- Scientific named-entity recognition
- Scientific article summarization
- Question-answering on scientific articles
- Citation context/span extraction
- Structured information extraction from full-text, tables, figures, bibliography
- Novel datasets curated from scientific publications
- Argument extraction and mining
- Challenges in information extraction from scientific articles
- Building knowledge graphs via mining scientific literature; querying scientific knowledge graphs
- Novel tools for IE on scientific literature and interaction with users
- Mathematical information extraction
- Scientific concepts, facts extraction
- Visualizing scientific knowledge
- Bibliometric and Altmetric studies via information extraction from scientific articles and metadata

In addition to research paper presentations, WIESP would also feature keynote talks, a panel discussion, and shared tasks. We will update the details on our website as and when they become available. We especially welcome participation from academic and research institutions, government and industry labs, publishers, and information service providers. Projects and organizations using NLP/ML techniques in their text mining and enrichment efforts are also welcome to participate. We strongly encourage the participation of students, researchers, and science practitioners from diverse backgrounds, especially from underrepresented groups and communities, to be a part of WIESP events, and proactively make the workshop a diverse and inclusive one.
