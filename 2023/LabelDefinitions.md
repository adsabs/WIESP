## Definitions of the Labels used in the FOCAL Shared Task
Below you will find the full list of labels used in the FOCAL shared task, along with their definitions and some examples.  

| **Label**                | **Definition**                                                                                                                  | **Example**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Background               | Citation whose purpose is to provide background information so that the reader can understand the problem, or the object.       | The AGN in these systems have been shown to deposit vast amounts of energy into the surrounding intracluster medium via heating and (mega-parsec scale) jets both observationally and by means of modelling (e.g. Binney 2004...                               |
| Motivation               | Citation that is used to justify the current work or problem.                                                                   | Unlike NGC 3894, for which no observations with Cherenkov telescopes have been performed, M 87 and 3C 84 are also detected at very high energy (VHE, E > 100 GeV; Aharonian et al. 2006                                                                        |
| Uses                     | Result or idea from cited work is used in the current work. Could be in the form of using data or an idea to build an argument. | Our data set consists of 4348 hr of data in both the nominal LPF configuration and the “Disturbance Reduction System” (DRS) configuration, in which a NASA-supplied controller and thruster system took over control of the spacecraft (Anderson et al. 2018). |
| Extends                  | Citing work is extending the results of the cited work.                                                                         | In doing so we extend the analysis of Planck Collaboration Int. XXXVIII (2016) and Planck Collaboration Int. XLIV (2016) to sky areas in which the filaments have very little contrast with respect to the diffuse background emission.                        |
| Similarities             | There are similarities, in results or observations, between the cited and citing works,                                         | All of these galaxies are consistent with the relationship between X-ray luminosity and mid-IR luminosity for starburst galaxies (...; Sell et al. 2014).                                                                                                      |
| Differences              | There are differences, in results or observations, between the cited and citing works,                                          | We also remark that the expression from Mishima et al. (1983) would give a penetration depth of 56 m at 2.2 cm, which is an order of magnitude larger than indicated by the laboratory measurements of Paillou et al. (2008)                                   |
| Compare/Contrast         | A neutral comparison between works or ideas                                                                                     | At these early epochs, this difference could be caused by the poor constraints on the GSMFs adopted by Duncan et al. (2019) which result in large uncertainties on their data, making it impossible to draw robust conclusions at z ~ 5.                       |
| Future Work              | Used when cited work provides a means to expand the scope of the citing work                                                    | The study presented here will also be further extended to explore the effects of different retention fractions of dark remnants (neutron stars and black holes; see, e.g., Giersz et al. 2019                                                                  |
| Unclear                  |                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
