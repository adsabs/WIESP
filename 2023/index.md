- Paper Presentations
- Keynote talks
- Shared task presentations
- Panel discussion
- Invited paper presentations

# Submission Site

Submission Link: https://softconf.com/aacl2022/WIESP/

# Shared Tasks

WIESP 2023 includes two shared task where we invite teams (individuals and groups) to come up with a system to tackle NLP challenges:

- [FOCAL: Function of Citations in Astrophysics Literature](SharedTasks)
- [2nd shared task TBD]

Participants will have the opportunity to present their findings during the workshop and write a short paper. The best performant or interesting approaches might be invited to further collaborate with the [NASA Astrophysical Data System](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/).

# Call for Papers

We invite regular and work-in-progress papers of the following categories:

- Long papers must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included. Papers must not exceed eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited pages of references. The final versions of long papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account.
- Short papers must describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead short papers should have a point that can be made in a few pages, such as a small, focused contribution; a negative result; or an interesting application nugget. Short papers must not exceed four (4) pages, plus unlimited pages of references. The final versions of short papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 5 pages) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account.
- Position papers will give voice to authors who wish to take a position on a topic listed above or the field of scholarly information extraction. Submissions need not present original work and should be two to four pages in length including title, text, figures and tables, and references. 
- Demo papers should be no more than four (4) pages in length, including references, and should describe implemented systems which are of relevance to the theme of the workshop. Authors of demo papers should be willing to present a demo of their system during WIESP at AACL-IJCNLP 2022.
- Extended Abstracts: We welcome submissions of extended abstracts (2 pages max) related to the research topics mentioned above. Submissions may include previously published results, late-breaking results, and work in progress, description of ongoing projects in the broad field of information extraction and mining from scientific publications. Extended abstracts can summarize existing work, work in progress, or a collection of works under a unified theme (e.g., a series of closely related papers that build on each other or tackle a common problem).

Submissions (Long and Short Papers) will be subject to a double-blind peer-review process. Position papers, Demo papers, and Extended Abstracts need not to be anonymized.
