## WIESP @ AACL-IJCNLP 2023 

The 2nd Workshop on Information Extraction from Scientific Publications will be held online at the [AACL-IJCNLP 2023](http://www.ijcnlp-aacl2023.org/) on November 2-4, 2023 and it will feature:

- Paper Presentations
- Keynote talks
- Shared task presentations
- Panel discussion
- Invited paper presentations
- A virtual social cum poster presentation

## Call for Papers

We invite papers of the following categories:

***Long papers*** must describe substantial, original, completed, and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included. Papers must not exceed eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited pages of references. The final versions of long papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account.

***Short papers*** must describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead, short papers should have a point that can be made in a few pages, such as a small, focused contribution, a negative result, or an interesting application nugget. Short papers must not exceed four (4) pages, plus unlimited pages of references. The final versions of short papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 5 pages) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account.

In addition to papers, WIESP will also host shared tasks. More details on the WIESP shared tasks would be available on our website shortly. Also, we will publish separate CfPs on the shared tasks. Shared task authors would be invited to write their system descriptions and those would be subjected to peer review.

***First Shared Task: Function of Citation in Astrophysics Literature (FOCAL)***

The citation graph is an essential tool for helping researchers find relevant literature. To further empower discovery, we aim to label the edges of the graph with the function of the citation: e.g. is the cited work necessary background knowledge, or is it used as a comparison, to the citing work? To start this process, we propose a shared task of automatically labeling citations with a function based on the  textual context of the citation. A sample dataset and more instructions can be found [here](shared_task_1)

All accepted papers would be published in the WIESP proceedings as part of IJCNLP-AACL 2023 and indexed in the ACL Anthology.

***Second Shared Task: TBD***

Instructions can be found [here](shared_task_2)
