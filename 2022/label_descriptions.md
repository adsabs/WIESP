## Definitions of the Labels used in the DEAL Shared Task
Below you will find the full list of labels used in the DEAL shared task, along with their definitions and some examples.  
In the dataset, tokens are labeled using the [IOB2 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside%E2%80%93outside%E2%80%93beginning_(tagging)) (ex: B-Archive, I-Archive).
