### WIESP @ AACL-IJCNLP 2022 

The first Workshop on Information Extraction from Scientific Publications will be held at the [AACL-ICNLP 2022](https://www.aacl2022.org/) and it will feature:

- Paper Presentations
- Keynote talks
- Shared task presentations
- Panel discussion
- Invited paper presentations
- A virtual social cum poster presentation

# Submission Site

TBA shortly

# Shared Tasks

WIESP includes one shared task where we invite teams (individuals and groups) to come up with a system to tackle a Name Entity Recognition (NER) challenge:

- [DEAL: Detecting Entities in the Astrophysics Literature](SharedTasks)

Participants will have the opportunity to present their findings during the workshop and write a short paper. The best performant or interesting approaches might be invited to further collaborate with the [NASA Astrophysical Data System](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/).

# Call for Papers

We invite regular and work-in-progress papers of the following categories:

- Long papers must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included. Papers must not exceed eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited pages of references. The final versions of long papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account.
- Short papers must describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead short papers should have a point that can be made in a few pages, such as a small, focused contribution; a negative result; or an interesting application nugget. Short papers must not exceed four (4) pages, plus unlimited pages of references. The final versions of short papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 5 pages) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account.
- Position papers will give voice to authors who wish to take a position on a topic listed above or the field of scholarly information extraction. Submissions need not present original work and should be two to four pages in length including title, text, figures and tables, and references. 
- Demo papers should be no more than four (4) pages in length, including references, and should describe implemented systems which are of relevance to the theme of the workshop. Authors of demo papers should be willing to present a demo of their system during WIESP at AACL-IJCNLP 2022.
- Extended Abstracts: We welcome submissions of extended abstracts (2 pages max) related to the research topics mentioned above. Submissions may include previously published results, late-breaking results, and work in progress, description of ongoing projects in the broad field of information extraction and mining from scientific publications. Extended abstracts can summarize existing work, work in progress, or a collection of works under a unified theme (e.g., a series of closely related papers that build on each other or tackle a common problem). 


# Important Dates

- Paper/Abstract Submission Deadline: August 25, 2022
- Notification of workshop paper/abstract acceptance: September 25, 2022
- Camera-ready Submission Deadline: October 10, 2022

# Registration

Please follow the instructions for conference registration provided on the [AACL-IJCNLP 2022](https://www.aacl2022.org/).


# Submissions

Submission will be via softconf (link to be updated shortly), they should follow the [ACLPUB formatting guidelines](https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html) and [template files](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files/tree/master). Submissions (Long and Short Papers) will be subject to a double-blind peer-review process. Position papers, Demo papers, and Extended Abstracts need not to be anonymized. Accepted papers will be presented by the authors at the workshop either as a talk or a poster. All accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings.

We follow the same policies as [AACL-IJCNLP 2022](https://www.aacl2022.org/) regarding preprints and double-submissions. The anonymity period for WIESP 2022 is from July 15 to September 25.
